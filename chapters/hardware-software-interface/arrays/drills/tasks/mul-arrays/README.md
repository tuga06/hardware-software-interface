# Mul-arrays

You will solve the exercises starting from the `mul_arrays.asm` file located in the `drills/tasks/mul-arrays` directory.
Write the Assembly instructions through which, for each pair of one-byte elements with identical indexes from `array1` and `array2`, their product is saved in `array3`.
Then print `array3`.

The program's output after a correct solution should be:

```Assembly
The array that results from the product of the corresponding elements in array1 and array2 is:
405 12801 1330 59397 2024 6151 280 8449 289 48385
```

Follow the comments marked with **TODO**.

**IMPORTANT**: The product should be computed between two one-byte numbers.
Therefore, the result is stored on two bytes.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../../reading/README.md) reading material.
