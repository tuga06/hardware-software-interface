# Task: Fixing Library Issues

Access the directory `tasks/lib-fix/support/`.
Run the `make` command, interpret the encountered error, and resolve it by editing the `Makefile`.
Refer to the `Makefile` in the directory `tasks/multiple-link/support/example/c-lib/`.

**Checker**: To test the implementation, enter the tests/ directory and run:

```console
./run_all_tests.sh
```

In case of a correct solution, you will get this output:

```console
./run_all_tests.sh

test_library_issue               ........................ passed ...  100

```
