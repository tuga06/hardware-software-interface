# Courses

You will solve the exercises starting from the `courses.asm` file located in the `drills/tasks/courses` directory.
Fill in the instructions to display the course in which each student is enrolled.
We will assume that each student is enrolled in at most one course.

The program's output after a correct solution should be:

```Assembly
The students list is:
Vlad ---- Assembly
Andrew ---- Linear Algebra
Kim ---- Linear Algebra
George ---- Physics
Kate ---- Student unassigned :(
```

Follow the comments marked with **TODO**.
