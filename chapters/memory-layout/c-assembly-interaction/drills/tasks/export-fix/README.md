Navigate to `drills/tasks/export-fix/support/`.

Each subdirectory (`support/a-func/`, `suppoer/b-var/`, `support/c-var-2/`) contains a problem related to exporting some symbols (functions or variables).
In each subdirectory, run the `make` command, identify the problem and edit the files needed to fix the problem.
