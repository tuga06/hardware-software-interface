# Task: Fibonacci Sum

You will solve the exercises starting from the `fibo_sum.asm` file located in the `tasks/fibonacci` directory.
Starting from the `fibo_sum.asm` file, implement a program that calculates the sum of the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using the `loop` instruction.
The sum of the first 9 numbers is 54.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../reading/structures.md) reading material.
